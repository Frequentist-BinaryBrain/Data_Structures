#   Introduction to Trees
#
#     Definition of Trees: Non-linear data structures with a hierarchical relationship between elements and devoid of cycles.
#     Purpose in Real Life: Trees are commonly utilized without explicit awareness in daily life scenarios like cafe menus, demonstrating their organizational efficiency.
#     Tree Data Structure Properties:
#         Hierarchical Form: Represents data in a hierarchical order, where each descending level signifies a more specialized category.
#         Components of Nodes: Nodes consist of data and references to subcategories, embodying a parent-child relationship.
#         Base Category and Subcategories: Emphasizes the existence of a base category and multiple subcategories within, depicting a hierarchical structure.
#
# Why We Need Tree Data Structure
#
#     Linear Data Structure Challenges: Linear data structures exhibit increased time complexity with growing data sizes.
#     Advantages of Trees:
#         Non-linear Access: Trees facilitate quicker access to data, addressing the shortcomings of linear structures.
#         Hierarchical Information Storage: Ideal for storing hierarchical data like folder structures or organizational charts.
#         Performance Improvement: Different tree types (e.g., binary search trees, AVL trees) excel in various applications, enhancing efficiency.
#
# Terminology of Tree Data Structure
#
#     Root: The topmost node without any parent, marking the starting point of the tree.
#     Edge: A link connecting a parent node to its child nodes, symbolizing the hierarchical relationship.
#     Leaf: Nodes without children, representing the terminal points of the tree structure.
#     Sibling: Nodes sharing the same parent, indicating a horizontal relationship within the hierarchy.
#     Ancestor: Includes parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent nodes, tracing the lineage of a given node.
#     Depth of Node: The length of the path from the root to a specific node, measured in edges.
#     Height of Node: The length of the path from a node to the deepest node in the tree, measured in edges.
#     Depth of Tree: The depth of the root node, always starting at zero.
#     Height of Tree: The height of the root node, signifying the length of the path to the deepest node.
